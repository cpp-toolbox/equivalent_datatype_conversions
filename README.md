SUBPROJECT

When working with multiple different libraries it's undoubtly the case that you will eventually run into two data types
that do the same thing.
For example with GLM and a physics engine it will probably be the case that they both have a matrix class, this
subproject aims to do all these conversions in a single isolated place.
